# CSFramework
Cyber Sickness framework is a Unity project developed by Adriano Viegas Milani under the supervision of Nana Tian as part of a semester project for the Immersive Interaction Research Group at EPFL. The main idea behind this project is to assist and standardize Cyber Sickness research.
Our solution is a complete Unity Project containing the necessary tools to set up an experiment: a customizable environment, organization for scripts, and an easily shareable preset system for component parameters.
