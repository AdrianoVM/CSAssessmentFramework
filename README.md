# Cybersickness Assessment Framework
Cybersickness Assessment framework is a Unity project developed by Adriano Viegas Milani under the supervision of Nana Tian for the Immersive Interaction Research Group at EPFL. The main idea behind this project is to assist and standardize Cyber Sickness research.
Our solution is a complete Unity Project containing the necessary tools to set up an experiment: a customizable environment, organization for scripts, and an easily shareable preset system for component parameters. 

 [**Video Explaining Version 1 of the project**](https://youtu.be/3boUl46NIeg)
 
 **Version 2 is currently in the works**, reworking quite a few things, and thus will be available on a new repository. When feature parity is attained, the link will be posted here. It will contain more locomotion and cybersickness related techniques, a more robust preset system, pre-tests, and documentation with tutorials.
